417-268-3000t's very fortunate none of them were struck, that was our biggest concern last night. We are uncertain if the shooter knew the kids were in there or not," said Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase.

Terrill’s whole family is shocked and grieving. Including his uncle who wants justice for his only nephew.

"I want to go to court I want to see these people. I want them to look at our faces and see how much pain we are going through because of their bad decision. It's horrible and painful," said Allen Nichols.

Detectives interviewed 8 people last night and are looking for 2 people of interest. Degase says Douglas County is working with authorities in Christian and Webster Counties to identify and track down the shooter. He says Terrill did have some criminal history, but the sheriff would not elaborate on that. Degase also said investigators are still working on a motive but says Terrill's criminal past may have contributed to his death.

"We are working closely with officials in Webster and Christian Counties on this. They are very familiar with both the victim and the suspects so we are working closely with the Sheriff's departments in both of those counties," Degase said.

An autopsy on the victim will be done on Monday.
