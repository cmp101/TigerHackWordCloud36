Final regular season volleyball power rankings

By Jordan Burton (For OzarksSportsZone.com)

Ozarks Sports Zone ranks the top teams in Southwest Missouri based on dominance by class, essentially the pound-for-pound comparison of those teams compared to the best in the state. Rankings are sponsored by CoxHealth. Below, you’ll also find our awards for last week’s top performances. If you’d like to nominate a player for O-Zone Player of the Week, please forward stats and information to thejordanburton1989@gmail.com.

NOTE: We will not do individual player awards this week. All-O-Zone Volleyball Awards will be released after the postseason.

1. (2) Strafford (C2: 27-4-1)

The Lady Indians are back on top, where they started the season. Strafford went undefeated in the Mid-Lakes and is the top seed in Class 2 – District 12, a district they share with rival Fair Grove. Although Grove hosts the district, Strafford still hasn’t lost a true road match since losing to Liberty at Liberty in the 2014 Elite Eight (27 straight road wins).

2. (4) Fair Grove (C2: 27-4-3)

I couldn’t pick between Fair Grove and Aurora, so I just gave it to them both. It’s fitting seeing how the two teams split their only meeting and neither has a bad loss. Fair Grove finished as the Mid-Lakes runner-up and is the No. 2 seed in Class 2 – District 12, which they host. The Lady Eagles are riding an 11-match unbeaten streak into districts.

2. (3) Aurora (C3: 27-3-2)

Aurora continues to be the hottest Class 3 team in the Ozarks, unbeaten in its last 13 matches. Aurora also won the Big 8, going undefeated in what is the final year of the conference before massive expansion. The Lady Houns are the No. 1 seed in Class 3 – District 11, which is hosted by Mount Vernon; the last team to take a set from them.

4. (5) Ozark (C4: 26-7-2)

The Lady Tigers are inching closer to the MaxPreps 100 thanks to loaded schedule. Ozark took three of four from district rivals Kickapoo and Nixa, which is why they earned the top seed in Class 4 – District 11. The COC Large champs are undefeated on neutral floors this year, which could be good considering Kickapoo hosts the district and the District 12 winner hosts sectionals/quarterfinals. Splitting with Helias and beating previously undefeated Living the Word Christian twice is a scary thing for everyone in Class 4.

5. (1) Rogersville (C3: 27-4-1)

Rogersville is in a tricky spot, thanks to injuries. On one hand, they’re the COC Small champs and No. 1 seed in Class 3 – District 11. On the other hand, the health of Birdie Hendrickson greatly impacts this team’s trajectory. She sported a brace in Thursday’s loss to Nixa. The Lady Cats are really good without her (going three with Kickapoo and splitting with Fair Grove in her absence) but they’ll need her healthy if they want to make it back to Cape.

6. (8) Kickapoo (C4: 26-6)

Lady Chiefs – Ozark Conference champions – get the honor of hosting Class 4 – District 11, which is about the toughest district in Missouri with four of the seven teams winning 20 games and the No. 5 seed Branson adding 19 wins. However, Kickapoo is the hottest Class 4 team in the Ozarks, winning nine straight since that loss to state power Lafayette.

7. (6) Willard (C4: 28-3-1)

Willard continues to be one of the most underrated Class 4 programs in Missouri. The Lady Tigers are the No. 1 seed in Class 4 – District 10, looking for their fourth straight district title. Nobody in the Ozarks has won more games than Willard. Potentially sharing a playoff pod with Blue Springs South (23-8), the District 11 winner (Ozark, Kickapoo, Nixa) and the District 12 winner (Carl Junction and Carthage) will offer a big-time challenge as Willard looks for a trip to Cape.

8. (7) Nixa (C4: 21-10)

Nixa has the best resume of any No. 3 seed in Missouri with wins over Rogersville and Kickapoo, among others. Annie Zimmerman now has 20-plus wins in three of her four seasons at Nixa. The Lady Eagles will play Glendale for a third time to open districts, likely setting up a third meeting with Kickapoo which would likely set up a third meeting with Ozark for either Kickapoo or Nixa.

9. (NR) Jasper (C1: 23-5-1)

Jasper split the SRVC title with Sarcoxie and enter the Class 1 – District 9 tournament as the No. 2 seed. The Lady Eagles have won 12 straight since losing to Liberal on Sep. 16. Liberal, that includes wins over Lockwood, Miller and College Heights. Jasper is seeking its third district title since 2013.

10. (NR) Sarcoxie (C2: 25-5-2)

The Lady Bears captured a share of the SRVC crown by beating Liberal in three on Tuesday, on Senior Night. Sarcoxie is 13-1-1 in its last 15 matches, which is why it earned the No. 1 seed in Class 2 – District 11, where they are seeking back-to-back titles.

Receiving Consideration: Marshfield (C3: 21-7-2), Winona (C1: 15-9-2), MV-BT/Liberty (C2: 23-9), New Covenant Academy (C1: 25-4-2), Lebanon (C4: 19-10-3) Liberal (C1: 22-5-2), Clever (C2: 19-8-4), Carthage (C4: 21-8-1), Carl Junction (C4: 21-9), West Plains (C4: 22-10)

College Spotlight

Rachel Rippee, Arkansas

Injuries robbed the Ozarks of seeing some of her greatness during her prep career at Kickapoo, but she’s more than made up for lost time. Rippee has 812 assists this season, which is tied for 12th nationally and has earned her SEC Setter of the Week honors. Her 1,804 assists and counting is already top-10 on Arkansas’ all-time list. The 6-foot- sophomore has had eight matches of 50-plus assists this season alone, including a career-high 59 against SMU.
