A Springfield mail carrier is being treated- after being attacked by a dog on the cityâ€™s north side

It happened on North Rogers Street just off Kearney. Everyone on the street heard screaming, ran outside and were shocked to see a dog on this mail woman. Her arm was in the dog's mouth. She had other bites to her leg and other areas.

One neighbor said he was able to beat the dog away. Apparently, a woman, believed to be the dog's owner, pulled up in a car, put the dog inside, and then took off. Police have been looking for her.

Other bystanders came to help the injured carrier, who was later taken away in an ambulance.

Multiple neighbors say they have seen the dog running at large several times. Those neighbors say it bit a 13-year-old child. They were afraid something like this would happen again.
