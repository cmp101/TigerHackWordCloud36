A vapor shop in Lebanon, Mo. is selling Hurts Donuts to help foster families.

All the funds raised will stay in the community and offer a new option of support to foster parents.

Hippie Holler Vapors will be raising money for Live to Give Hope, a local nonprofit organization, by selling donuts.

All the money will fund a new program right inside the vapor shop.

The plan is to make this store's back storage room a closet full of supplies like clothes and baby formula to help foster families in Laclede County.

The money will help get supplies for all ages so foster parents have somewhere to go when they need it.

"Live to Give Hope is just starting an initiative called 'fostering hope' and it's going to be a closet that's going to be the needs of foster care kids, so everything from diapers and bottles, to school supplies and clothes because it's a huge burden for foster families when they get a new placement a lot of times they get nothing or very little," Laura Angst, Owner of Hippie Holler Vapors, said.

"It's a huge burden if they don't know if they're going to have a newborn or a 17-year-old," Angst said. "They kind of have to have a closet like this in each of their homes and we want to kind of want to take the burden off of them."

Hurts Donuts will be available for sale by the dozen or individually.

A dozen is priced at $20 and individual donuts will be $3 a piece.

The store hopes to have the closet fully ready to go by the end of the month to help foster families and will also begin accepting donations.

The store is located right off Jefferson Street, at 434 S. Jefferson Ave, and will open up at 10 a.m.
