Missouri State sets school records in 3-2 win at Drake

DES MOINES, Iowa — Missouri State remained unbeaten in the Missouri Valley Conference and ended Drake’s 10-match win streak Friday at the Knapp Center, setting school records for single-match digs and attacks in a 3-2 victory.

The Bears (15-5, 7-0 MVC) were victorious by set scores of 22-25, 25-20, 25-18, 30-32 and 15-9, dropping the Bulldogs to 17-4 and 6-1 in MVC play in the first of consecutive matches against fellow unbeaten league foes with a trip to No. 20 UNI (17-4, 7-0) set for 7 p.m. Saturday.

Missouri State committed 11 attack errors in a sloppy first set to fall behind, then evened the score after pulling away from a 15-all tie in the second period.

The Bears did not trail in the third set after Cambree Villarreal hit two of her career-high 15 kills in a 3-0 run for an 8-5 lead in the third, and led throughout the fourth set until Drake gained its first advantage at 24-23. MSU had five match point chances in the set before the Bulldogs ultimately prevailed.

Missouri State never trailed in the fifth set, hitting .435 as a team behind six kills on 10 swings from Lily Johnson, who tallied 28 in the match. Senior Lauren Boone added two more winners in the final frame to finish with a season-high 11.
